# 🍎 link🌴-ios

Link3 IOS is a lightweight iOS app that utilises [enstate.rs](https://github.com/v3xlabs/enstate) for blazingly fast ENS record display.

## 💻 Prerequisites

Owning a mac lol.

## 📱 Installation

First, clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/AnaArsonist/link3-ios`

Next run the build via Xcode, normally by hitting `⌘ + R`

## 📡 Future

Due to the time constraints of this being produced in a hackathon, this is extremely minimal but should hopefully be more developed in the future!
